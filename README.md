# ExitCall 📞

A privacy-first emergency exit assist app

## Inspiration

ExitCall was inspired by situations many people have experienced: being stuck in an uncomfortable conversation, a bad date, or a moment that simply doesn’t feel right. Leaving abruptly can feel awkward or risky, and calling someone for help isn’t always possible. We wanted to create a tool that empowers people to exit gracefully, quickly, and safely—without escalation or confrontation.

## What It Does

ExitCall simulates a believable incoming phone call, giving users a socially acceptable reason to leave an uncomfortable or unsafe situation.

Users can:

- Choose who’s calling (e.g., Mom, Dad, trusted contact)
- Trigger an emergency call with a single tap
- Receive a realistic iPhone-style incoming call
- Answer the call and step away naturally

The entire experience is designed to feel native, fast, and intuitive, even in high-stress situations.

## How We Built It

ExitCall was designed as a high-fidelity iOS prototype using Figma, closely following Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines. We focused on realism and usability to demonstrate an end-to-end experience suitable for both real-world use and a hackathon pitch.

Key design elements include:

- iOS Settings–style home screen
- Realistic incoming call and in-call screens
- Native spacing, typography, and animations
- Smooth interactive flows using Smart Animate

The front-end was implemented using JavaScript and React to demonstrate functional UI components and interaction logic.

## Challenges We Faced

One of our biggest challenges was balancing realism with responsibility. We aimed to create an authentic experience without directly cloning system UI or crossing ethical boundaries. We also designed specifically for high-stress scenarios, ensuring the app remains simple, fast, and usable when users may be nervous or distracted.

## Accomplishments We’re Proud Of

- Created a highly realistic iOS-style prototype that feels native
- Delivered a clear, emotionally resonant solution in under 4 hours
- Designed with privacy-first principles: no tracking, no recording, no data storage
- Framed ExitCall as a preventative safety tool, not a prank app

## What We Learned

- Small design details (spacing, motion, language) build user trust
- Safety tools must prioritize consent, transparency, and simplicity
- Emotional context matters as much as technical execution
- Designing for “exit moments” is a powerful and underexplored problem space

## What’s Next

Planned future features for ExitCall include:

- Opt-in live location sharing with trusted contacts during emergencies
- Keyword-based escalation, allowing users to trigger real calls with preset phrases
- Trusted contact management and safety check-ins

Our goal is to evolve ExitCall into a privacy-first safety companion that helps users exit early and escalates only when necessary.
